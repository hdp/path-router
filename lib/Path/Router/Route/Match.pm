=item B<new>

=item B<path>

This is the path that was matched.

=item B<mapping>

This is the mapping of your router part names to the actual parts of 
the path. If your route had no "variables", then this will be an empty 
HASH ref.

=item B<route>

This is the L<Path::Router::Route> instance that was matched.

=item B<target>

This method simply delegates to the C<target> method of the C<route>
that was matched.
